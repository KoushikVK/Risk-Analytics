# Risk-Analytics


This case study aims to show how EDA may be applied in a real-world corporate setting.
In this case study, we will obtain a fundamental understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services, as well as how data is used to decrease the risk of losing money while lending to consumers, in addition to using the methodologies gained in the EDA module.

Due to their weak or non-existent credit history, lending providers find it difficult to grant loans to customers. As a result, some consumers take advantage of the situation by becoming defaulters. Assume you work for a consumer finance firm that specializes in providing urban consumers with various sorts of loans. To analyze the patterns in the data, you'll need to apply EDA. This will guarantee that the applicants are not turned down because they are unable to repay the loan.

 

When a firm receives a loan application, it must evaluate whether or not to approve the loan based on the applicant's profile. The bank's choice is related with two sorts of risks:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, the company will lose business if the loan is not approved.

Approving the loan may result in a financial loss for the firm if the applicant is unlikely to repay the loan, i.e. if he or she is likely to default.

 

The data given below contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:

The client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample,

All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time.

 

 

When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client/company):

###### Approved: 
The Company has approved loan Application

###### Cancelled: 
During the approval process, the client cancelled the application. Either the customer changed his or her mind about the loan, or in certain situations, due to the client's increased risk, he obtained less favorable pricing, which he did not desire.




###### Refused: 
The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).

###### Unused offer:  
Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.
